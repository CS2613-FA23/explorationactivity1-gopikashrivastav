# ExplorationActivity1


1. Which package/library does the sample program demonstrate?

    The sampe program explores the OpenCV(Open Source Computer Vision) and machine learning library in python that is used for image processing and performing computer vision tasks[1]
    It also uses Mediapipe, Google's open-source framework, used for media processing.



2. How does someone run your program?

    The program requires the latest version of opencv and mediapipe to be installed. This was done by using pip commands in the terminal. 

    $ pip install opencv-python
    $ pip install mediapipe

    Once these are installed, the HandTrackModule class can be run on the terminal. The webcam settings might need to be changed depending upon the device [refer to HandTrackModule line 65, line 66]. 

3. What purpose does your program serve?

        The program utilises the Hand Land Mark Model in MediaPipe [picture below]
